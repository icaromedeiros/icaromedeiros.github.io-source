On this post I will briefly discuss two presentations I have made in SÃ£o Paulo in early November/2015.

Statistics: the Grammar of Data Science
---------------------------------------

As I decided to become a data scientist (link to some post about how to become a data scientist),
I've noticed that my statistics background was not good (btw, Computer Science majors should emphasize it more).

So I've started to dive into Statistics courses (link to udacity courses), books, and blog posts.
I have learned a lot and two materials standed up (?) for their graspness (?): Statistics for Hackers and Naked Statistics.

Inspired by their approach of giving simple examples to teach complex subjects I thought I could do the same in a conference.
And based on the audience receptiveness I think I have done this task.

The talk goes through misuses, metrics, methods, and meaning (i.e. communication).
Some (classic) examples like correlation vs. causation and p-hacking are shown in a light way (i.e. memes and cool visualizations).
