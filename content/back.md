I'm back
========

Hi folks.

I have blogged [elsewhere](http://kirux.wordpress.com) during my Master's [2008-2009], in portuguese.

Now I have this new blog proudly built using [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/), [Python](python.org), both [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [RestructuredText](http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html), and the *awesome ultimate blogging deploy system* that [Github Pages](pages.github.com) offers.

A few words about blogging tools
--------------------------------

Some of my not-so-formal requirements for a blogging tool that made me did these choices:

1. I don't want emails, social media, or internet connection getting in the way of writing.
- I don't need a WYSIWYG tool, a [great but simple text editor](vim.org) will work.
- I want static pages and control the HTML output.
- I want a smooth deploy.
- I want to import my old posts nicely.
- I want i18n (i.e. write both in pt-br and en).
- I want to write semantic annotation in my posts.
- I want my blog to be responsive.

[Wordpress](wordpress.org) is enough for most people, but basically fails in items 1, 2, 3.

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)/[Octopress](http://octopress.org/) seemed more programmer-friendly from the start, but Python seemed a low entry barrier than Ruby as Python is, specially for implementing microdata semantic annotation (item 7).
